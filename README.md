# Phonebook Buddy

Phonebook developed in C# to store Contact Information. The app is currently in development and well underway. I was able to get through
the first stage of development and am now working on the connectivity. The application is meant to take in First and Last name, phone number,
email, and how you know them. It is simple so far and I have always wanted to make a phonebook so this is great practice working with 
databases. Excited to see what comes next.

Currently running into SQL connectivity error 40 which means
it cannot establish a connection. Can't wait to take a look at this next time and progress! I have some screenshots below of the current 
stage as well as the error message that pops up.
